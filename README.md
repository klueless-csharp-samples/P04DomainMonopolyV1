## Classic Monopoly Rules

### Objective

The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property.

[cmd:player:get-piece]
Each player chooses one token to represent him/her while traveling around the board.
[/cmd]

### Banker

The bank / auctioneer is controlled by the computer.

Besides the Bank’s money, the [cmd:game:generate-title-deed]Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the players.[/cmd]

[cmd] The Bank pays salaries and bonuses.

[svc]/[svc] It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards

[cmd] It sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.

[cmd] The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of
all properties which it sells and auctions.

The Bank never "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker
may issue as much more as needed by writing on any ordinary paper.


### Play

#### Before start

Place player token on the square marked "GO,"

Players sit in a circle around the board and each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play.

#### Start

1. [cmd] throw the dice and move your token in the direction of the arrow the number of spaces indicated by the dice. For the very first move of the game, you can can read the current_die value as the throw already happened before start
2. [cmd] After you have completed your play, the turn passes to the player on your the left (clockwise). The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from that point on.
3. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time.

[svc] According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to buy real estate or other properties — or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail," etc.

#### Doubles
If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which you land.

Retaining the dice, throw again and move your token as before.

[qry]/[cmd] If you throw doubles three times in succession,
move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail"

#### GO
  
[src]/[cmd] Each time a player's token lands on or passes over GO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card, the Banker pays him/her a $200 salary.

The $200 is paid only once each time around the board. However, if a player passing GO on the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it on Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond it on Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, he/she collects $200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the
second time by instructions on the card.

#### Buying Property

[svc]
Whenever you land on an [qry] unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership; place it faceup in front of you.

[svc] If you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction to the highest bidder.

The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property.

Any player, including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

#### Paying Rent

[svc] When you land on property owned by another player, the [cmd] owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on its [qry] Title Deed card.

[predicate] If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed facedown in front of the owner.

[cmd]/[predicate] It is advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color group (eg. Boardwalk and Park Place; or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group.

This rule applies to unmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged.

It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.

The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.

#### Chance and Community Chest

[svc]
When you [pred] land on either of these spaces, [qry] take the top card from the deck indicated, [action] follow theinstructions and [action] return the card face down to the bottom of the deck.

[iface] The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use it, he/she may sell it, at any time, to another player at an agreed price agreeable to both.

#### Income Tax

[pred] If you land here you have two options: [action] You may estimate your tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or you may pay 10% of your total worth to the Bank. Your total worth is all your cash on hand, printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged properties and cost price of all buildings you own.

You must decide which option you will take before you add up your total worth.

#### Super/Luxury Tax

[pred] If you land here you then [action] you have to pay $100 to the Bank.

#### Jail

[srv:GoToJail]
You land in Jail when...
- (1) [pred] your token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail"; 
- (2) [pred] you draw a card marked "Go to Jail"; or
- (3) [pred] you throw doubles three times in succession.

When you are sent to Jail you cannot collect your $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where your token is on the board, you must move it a directly into Jail. Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.

If you are not "sent" to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on that space, you are "Just Visiting," you incur no penalty, and you move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

[pred] InJail - am I in jail

[srv:GetOutOfJail]
You get out of Jail by...
- (1) throwing doubles on any of your next three turns; if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw: even though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn;
- (2) using the "Get Out of Jail Free" card if you have it; 
- (3) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and playing it;
- (4) paying a fine of $50 before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.

If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw.

Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell property, buy and sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

#### Free Parking

A player landing on this place does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a "free"
resting place.

#### Houses

When you own all the properties in a color-group you may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties.

If you buy one house, you may put it on any one of those properties. The next house you buy must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-group you may own.

The price you must pay the Bank for each house is shown on your Title Deed card for the property on which you erect the house.

The owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his/her complete color-group.

Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgement and financial standing will allow. But
you must build evenly, ie., you cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on every property of that group.

You may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property.

For example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have only one house on another property of that group.

As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).

HOTELS: When a player has four houses on each property of ax
complete color-group, he/she may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect
it on any property of the color-group. He/she returns the four houses
from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown
on the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one
property.

BUILDING SHORTAGES: When the Bank has no houses to sell, players
wishing to build must wait for some player to retum or sell his/her
houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of
houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more
than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the
highest bidder.

 
SELLING PROPERTY: Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities
(out not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction
for any amount the awner can get; however, no property can be sold to
another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-
group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before
the owner can sell any property of that color-group.

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-
half the price paid for them.

All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected,

All hotels on one colorgroup may oe sold at once, or they may be
sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

MORTGAGES: Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the
Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged, all
the duildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back
to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title
Deed card.

No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities,
but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the
same group.

In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
arnount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the prowerties of
a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
back houses at full price.

The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and
no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player
at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage
at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus
10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted
at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when ws
you buy the property and if you lift the
mortgage later you must pay the Bank J me
an additional 10% interest as well = « ;
as the amount of the mortgage. )

 
BANKRUPTCY: You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you
can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your
debt is to another player, you must tum over to that
player all that you have of value and retire from the
game. In making this settlement, if you own houses or
hotels, you must return these to the Bank in exchange
for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid
for them; this cash is given to the creditor. If you have
mortgaged property you also tum this property over
to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay .
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of
the property. The new owner who does this may then, at his/her option,
pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then lift the
mortgage. If he/she holds property in this way until a later turn, he/she
must pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage.

Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you
can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings
and mortgaging property, you must tum over all assets to the Bank. In
this case, the Bank immediately sells oy auction all property so taken,
except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the
game. The last player left in the game wins.

MISCELLANEOUS: Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank
and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or
lend money to another player.
