  // standing will allow. But you must build evenly, ie., you cannot erect more than
  // one house on any one property of any color-group until you have built one house
  // on every property of that group.
  // You may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four
  // houses to a property.
  // For example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have only one
  // house on another property of that group.
